This game is made with Python in pygame!

## Story

This is my first ever project I've made using pygame, I've learned a lot about game development, just with this project, I learned that game development, is a lot similar, yet very different to web development. I learned the way objects move, or "seem" to move, or how to display object, and how the person can interact with the application using keyboard event listeners.

This was going to be just another lame python flappybird game, however, for the campfire flagship the minimum hour requirement for each project is 5 hours, and I only had 3, so I had to add something more.... and I added powerups and curses!
