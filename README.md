# My first ever python game!

Itch: https://yevheniiasimakagmailcom.itch.io/flappy-bird

This game is made with Python in pygame!

This is my first ever project I've made using pygame, I've learned a lot about game development, just with this project, I learned that game development, is a lot similar, yet very different to web development. I learned the way objects move, or "seem" to move, or how to display object, and how the person can interact with the application using keyboard event listeners.
